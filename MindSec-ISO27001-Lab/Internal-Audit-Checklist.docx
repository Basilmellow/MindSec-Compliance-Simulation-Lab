Auditor Comments:
Overall, the ISMS framework and technical controls are well implemented across the organization. Most management and Annex A control requirements are compliant. However, the backup control (A.12.1) is still in draft and needs to be finalized and approved. It is recommended to complete the documentation and verify the effectiveness of the backup process through testing.
